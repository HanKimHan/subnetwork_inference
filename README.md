# Bayesian Deep Learning via Subnetwork Inference
This repository contains the code accompanying the paper "Bayesian Deep Learning via Subnetwork Inference" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14689) which was published at ICML 2021.
The code is still being cleaned up and detailed documentation will be added soon.
